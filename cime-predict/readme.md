# A Machine Learning program to predict the possible kind of crime depending on the location of the crime.

The KNN algorithm has been used in this program.

The prediction is roughly accurate.

The dataset consisted of 56k entries of which only 2k were used due to CPU Limitations and easier computing.

One particular "crime" outnumbered the rest due to which mostly the output is that particular crime.

A better dataset would have given a better prediction.
