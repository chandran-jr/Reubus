# A Machine Learning program to predict the possible kind of crime depending on the location of the crime.

This is a basic program just to know and figure out which algorithm works best for such datasets.

The dataset had 5.6 lakh entries/rows.

The KNN model was used and after a certain number of epochs an accuracy of 96% was achieved.

This program will be the basic skeleton for the backend ML model
