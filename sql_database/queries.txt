How to select queries

1. Query: Select * from crimedata where crimeID=001

 Ans: Selects all the data from the table crime data with crimeID 001


2. Query: Select * from crimedata 
 Ans: Prints all the data in crime data

3. Query: Select name, place, Vehicle
          From crimedata c
	  Inner join Properties p
	  ON c.crimeID = p.crimeID
	  Inner join Vehicle v
          ON p.crimeID = v.crime_id

  Ans: Joining 3 tables.. You can print required data later.

Join crimeid in each table to ger data d=from more than 1 table at a time.

You can also join 2 tables using the third case.

Just play around with these.

The inputting part is easy.. just copy paste the input section of corresponding table and enter their values.
